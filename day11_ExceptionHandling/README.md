# Day 11 – Exception Handling in Python

## Overview
Day 11 focuses on Exception Handling in Python. This module explains how to handle runtime errors gracefully so that programs do not crash unexpectedly. Both theoretical concepts and practical implementations are covered through structured practice programs, mini projects, and a mega project.

---

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what exceptions are and why they occur
- Use try, except, else, and finally blocks correctly
- Handle specific exceptions instead of generic errors
- Validate user input to avoid runtime failures
- Apply exception handling in real-world applications

---

## Concepts Covered
- try and except blocks
- Handling multiple exceptions
- try–except–else
- try–except–finally
- Raising exceptions manually
- Common Python runtime errors

---

## Exceptions Practiced
- ValueError
- ZeroDivisionError
- IndexError
- KeyError
- FileNotFoundError
- TypeError
- Exception (generic)

---

## Practice Programs
The practice folder contains programs that demonstrate:
- Basic exception handling
- Handling multiple exceptions in a single program
- Proper use of else and finally blocks
- Manual raising of exceptions
- Input validation techniques

---

## Mini Projects
The mini projects apply exception handling to real-world scenarios such as:
- Safe calculator operations
- ATM withdrawal system
- Student marks validation
- File handling with error control
- Login system with dictionary validation

---

## Mega Project
The mega project is a menu-driven Student Management System that integrates:
- Dictionaries and lists
- File handling
- Multiple exception types
- Input validation
- Continuous program execution

This project demonstrates application-level exception handling.

---

## How to Run
Navigate to the required folder and run any file using:
```bash
python filename.py
```

---

 ## Skills Gained
 - Writing crash-free Python programs
 - Handling runtime errors professionally
 - Debugging and validation techniques
 - Structuring real-world Python projects
