# 📅 Day 16 – Data Fundamentals & NumPy Introduction

## 📌 Topics Covered
Day 16 focuses on understanding **what data is**, how it is categorized, and how **NumPy** is used to process data efficiently in Python.

### Concepts
- What is Data
- Structured vs Unstructured Data
- Why Data Matters in Engineering
- Introduction to NumPy
- NumPy Arrays (`ndarray`)
- Vectorized Operations
- Numerical & Matrix Computation

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
By the end of Day 16, you will be able to:
- Differentiate between structured and unstructured data
- Understand real-world data in system engineering
- Use NumPy arrays instead of Python lists
- Perform fast numerical computations
- Process matrix-based data such as images
