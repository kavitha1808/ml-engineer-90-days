# 📊 Day 23 – Data Visualization Fundamentals

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains practical implementations of data visualization concepts using Matplotlib and Seaborn. 

The goal of this project is to understand how to visually analyze data, identify patterns, detect outliers, and interpret correlations using different types of plots.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### 🔹 Basic Visualizations
- Line Plot
- Scatter Plot
- Histogram
- Correlation Heatmap

### 🔹 Advanced Concept
- Subplots (Multiple plots in one figure)
- Dashboard-style visualizations
- Distribution analysis
- Feature correlation analysis
