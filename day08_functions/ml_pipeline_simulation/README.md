# Machine Learning Pipeline Simulation (Conceptual)

This program simulates a basic machine learning pipeline using Python functions.

No ML libraries are used.
The goal is to understand **pipeline thinking**, not algorithms.

---

## Pipeline Stages

1. Load raw data
2. Clean invalid values
3. Train a simple model
4. Evaluate the model

---

## Engineering Perspective

Real ML systems are built as pipelines.
This program reflects how data flows through each stage in production systems.

---

## Future Extension

This structure directly maps to real ML tools such as:
- Scikit-learn pipelines
- Airflow DAGs
- MLflow workflows
