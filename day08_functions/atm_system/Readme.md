# ATM System — Functional Logic Simulation

This program simulates the internal logic of an ATM machine using Python functions.

The focus is on **authentication and transaction flow**, not UI.

---

## Workflow

1. User enters PIN
2. PIN is verified
3. Withdrawal is processed
4. Balance is updated and displayed

---

## Concepts Applied

- Function return values for validation
- Conditional execution based on authentication
- Shared state management

---

## Interview Relevance

ATM logic is a common interview problem.
This implementation demonstrates correct functional decomposition.
