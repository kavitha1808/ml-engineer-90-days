# Student Grading System — Functional Decomposition

This program models a student grading workflow using Python functions.

---

## Workflow

1. Store student marks
2. Calculate total marks
3. Compute average
4. Assign grade
5. Generate report card

---

## Design Philosophy

- Each function performs exactly one task
- Calculations are reusable
- Report generation is separated from logic

---

## Scalability

This structure can be easily extended to:
- File input/output
- Database storage
- Web-based grading systems
