# Day 6 – Python Dictionaries 🧠🐍

This folder contains **in-depth practice code and mini projects** focused on **Python Dictionaries**.  
The goal is to build **strong logic and data-handling skills** using only core Python concepts.

This is part of my **90-Day Python / ML Engineer Preparation Plan**.

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Dictionary creation and syntax
- Key–value access
- Dictionary methods (`keys()`, `values()`, `items()`, `get()`, `pop()`)
- Iterating through dictionaries
- Frequency counting patterns
- Merging dictionaries manually
- Inverting dictionaries
- Sorting dictionaries by values (logic-based)
- Real-world problem solving using dictionaries

---

## 🧪 Practice File

### `day06_dictionaries_practice.py`
Contains **multiple practice questions with solutions**, including:
- Key existence checking
- List to dictionary conversion
- First non-repeating character
- Dictionary merging
- Inversion and sorting logic
- Interview-style dictionary problems

## 🚀 Mini Projects

### 1️⃣ Student Report Card
- Calculates total, average, and grade using subject-wise marks.

### 3️⃣ Phone Book Application
- Retrieves contact numbers using name-based lookup.

### 3️⃣ Pass / Fail Analyzer
- Determines subject-wise pass or fail status.

### 4️⃣ Character Frequency Counter
- Counts occurrence of each character in a string.
