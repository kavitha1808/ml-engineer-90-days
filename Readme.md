# ML Engineer – 90 Days Execution Plan 🚀

This repository documents my structured 90-day execution plan to become a
Machine Learning Engineer by building small, real, hands-on projects every day.

The focus is on **consistency, fundamentals, and engineering thinking**
rather than just theory or notebook-only work.

---

## 📌 What This Repository Contains

- Daily Python, data handling, machine learning, and deployment projects
- Each day is split into:
  - **1 hour of concept learning**
  - **1 hour of hands-on implementation**
- Clean, incremental progress with daily GitHub commits

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder represents one day of work:
day01_number_operations/ day02_conditions_logic/ day03_... ...

Every day usually includes:
- Python source code
- A README explaining:
  - Objective
  - Concepts used
  - What was built

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of this 90-day plan, I aim to:
- Build strong Python fundamentals
- Handle real-world data using Pandas and SQL
- Implement core machine learning algorithms
- Think like an ML engineer, not just a notebook user
- Deploy and structure ML projects professionally
- Be interview- and placement-ready

---

## 🔥 Progress Tracker

- ✅ Day 1: Number Operations Utility (Python fundamentals & functions)
- ⏳ Day 2: In progress

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Evolving)

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- SQL
- FastAPI
- Docker
- Git & GitHub

---

## 📖 Note

This repository is a learning log.
Projects are intentionally small and incremental, designed to build
strong foundations step by step.

Consistency > Perfection.
