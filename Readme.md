# 90-Day Machine Learning Engineer Plan

This repository documents my **structured 90-day execution plan** to become a
**Machine Learning Engineer** by building **small, real, hands-on projects daily**.

The focus is on **consistency**, **strong fundamentals**, and **engineering thinking** —
not just theory or notebook-only work.

---

## 📌 What This Repository Contains

- Daily Python, data handling, machine learning, and deployment work
- Each day is split into:
  - **1 hour – concept learning**
  - **1 hour – hands-on implementation**
- Clean, incremental progress with **daily GitHub commits**

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder represents **one day of work**:
day01_number_operations/ day02_conditions_logic/ day03_...

Each day typically includes:
- Python source code
- A README explaining:
  - Objective
  - Concepts used
  - What was implemented

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of this 90-day plan, I aim to:

- Build strong Python fundamentals
- Handle real-world data using Pandas and SQL
- Implement core machine learning algorithms
- Think like an ML engineer, not just a notebook user
- Structure and deploy ML projects professionally
- Be **interview- and placement-ready**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Evolving)

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- SQL
- FastAPI
- Docker
- Git & GitHub

---

## 📖 Note

This repository is a **learning log**.  
Projects are intentionally **small and incremental**, designed to build strong
foundations step by step.

**Consistency > Perfection**
