# Day 14 – OOP Continued (Encapsulation & Inheritance)

This module demonstrates practical usage of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
concepts in Python through real-world mini projects. The focus is on
**Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, and understanding **when OOP is useful**.

---

## Concepts Implemented

### 1. Encapsulation
- Use of private variables to protect internal data
- Controlled modification of sensitive attributes through methods
- Applied in stock handling, medical records, and financial balances

### 2. Inheritance
- Parent–child class relationships
- Method overriding to extend or modify behavior
- Reuse of base class logic across multiple systems

### 3. When OOP Is Useful
- Systems with multiple interacting entities
- Applications requiring data protection
- Scalable designs with future extensibility
- Real-world domain modeling
