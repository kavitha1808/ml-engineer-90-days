# Day 09 – Python Modules

This project is part of my Python learning journey and focuses on understanding
**modules, imports, reusable utilities, and basic project structure**.

Day 09 helps transition from single-file scripts to **well-organized,
multi-file Python projects**, similar to real-world applications.

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Python modules
- Importing files
- Creating custom modules
- Writing reusable utility functions
- Understanding `__init__.py`
- Basic project structure

## 📄 Folder Description

### Main.py
- Entry point of the project
- Imports functions from the `Utils` folder
- Controls program execution and output

### Utils/
- Contains reusable utility modules
- Includes only logic (no input or print statements)
- Designed for reuse across files

### practice/
- Used for practicing imports and module behavior
- Helps in understanding how Python resolves modules
- Not part of the final application

### Student_result/
- Mini project using multiple modules
- Demonstrates clean separation of logic and execution
